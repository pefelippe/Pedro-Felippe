          Hello there, Iâ€™m Pedro Felippe!
        </h1>
        <span className="text-lg font-normal">
          Currently I am based in Seattle working as a Product Designer at
          Microsoft, previously at Airbnb. I graduated from the University of
          Washington with a Bachelors in Interaction Design in 2020.
          <br />
          <br /> My focus is predominantly product design, but I also dabble in
          visual design, illustration, and I love making icons and pixel art!
          New technology, such as blockchain, big data, and augmented reality
          excites me!
          <br />
          <br /> I hope to apply design thinking to harness the power of
          innovations like these to help create a better future for everyone.{" "}
          <br />
          <br /> If you would like to reach me, or maybe even meet for some
          coffee (or boba!), email me at clairedycat.kantner@gmail.com
